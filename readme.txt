Some personal Vim color schemes for Mac's default terminal, made by editing the 256 color palette values in Gruvbox (hex colors may not be accurate to the theme).

Current:
1) beyond-the-future.vim - based on the art from this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uR-HUrZ1AE
2) yae-miko.vim - based on the character Yae Miko

Would also recommend using additional plugins (e.g. https://github.com/bfrg/vim-c-cpp-modern) toget better grouping for coloring.
